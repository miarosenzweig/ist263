<body>
My name is Mia Rosenzweig.
I am a junior studying economics and data analytics. I am interested in analyzing and manipulating data. I hope to gain an understanding of the different economies and how to develop policies based off of quantitive research.
I have knowledge in HTML, SQL, R, Python, Microsoft Suite, ALteryX, Tableau.

Outside of work I enjoy trying new things whether that is travelling to a new place, trying new foods or gaining a new experience.  Some unique things about me is that I can speak 3 languages and have been to over 15 countries.
